                        <h4>
                            Rock music emerged in the United States in the 1950s, as a fusion of several musical genres, including blues, country, and gospel. It was characterized by its driving beat, electric guitar riffs, and powerful vocals. Early pioneers of rock music include Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, and Little Richard, who helped establish the genre's foundations. In the 1960s, rock music continued to evolve, with the emergence of British bands like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, who brought new influences and experimentation to the genre. In the following decades, rock music would continue to diversify, with subgenres such as punk, heavy metal, and grunge, each leaving their own unique mark on the genre's history.
